DIY Doctrine Connect Bible Verses and Ideas
=

**Note:** This project is process.  At some point it will be a way for people to connect a Bible verse with an idea or doctrine through a web interface.  Right now it might be used as an MVC/Spring/Hibernate template.

Status
-
The project currently will display a menu and log you in if it finds a matching user name in the DB.

Next Up
-
Add and update an "Editor" (what a normal user is called).

Technologies
-
The project uses Spring, Hibernate, and [ThymeLeaf](http://www.thymeleaf.org/index.html).  I use ThymeLeaf for both my HTML templating and as a JSP replacement.  ThymeLeaf templates are real HTML that can render without an HTTP server and yet allow dynamic data to be added.
